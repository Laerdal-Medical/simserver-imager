  * Download Resume: Add support for resuming interrupted downloads on
    startup with user confirmation dialog
  * Branch Filter Persistence: Save and restore last selected branch filter
    across app restarts
  * Device Readiness Polling: Replaced fixed sleep delays with intelligent
    device readiness polling across all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).
    Operations complete faster when devices are ready and wait longer when
    devices need more time.
  * Drive List Refresh: Improved drive list refresh and UI updates
  * Touch Scrolling: Improved touch screen scrolling behavior across all
    list views and scrollable areas with smoother deceleration and better
    tap vs scroll gesture detection

    search for quickly finding branches in large repositories. Combobox now
    selects matching branch while typing and is fully editable.
  * Windows Upgrade Fix: Preserve user cache and settings during Windows
    installer upgrades
  * macOS Build Fix: Resolve deprecation warnings and use thin LTO for
    faster builds. Fixed QRegularExpression usage in mount helper.
  * Windows FAT32 Fix: Support formatting drives larger than 32GB as FAT32
    by using explicit 32KB cluster size to bypass Windows' artificial limit
  * Linux io_uring Optimization: Limit async I/O queue depth to 4 when using
    O_DIRECT to prevent massive latency buildup on USB devices. Reduces
    end-of-write drain time from ~175 seconds to ~2 seconds.
  * Write Progress Logging: Added periodic progress logging showing MB
    written, speed in MB/s, and pending writes for better diagnostics
  * SelectionListDelegate: New reusable QML delegate component providing
    consistent styling for list items with icon, title, description, badges,
    and metadata across all wizard selection screens
  * Deferred Artifact Download: CI artifacts are now downloaded only when
    user double-clicks or presses Next, reducing unnecessary downloads when
    browsing the artifact list
  * SPU Copy Flow: Improved SPU file copy workflow with auto-advance to
    done step and dedicated completion message for SPU operations
  * Mount Helper Fix: Check if device is already mounted before trying to
    get exclusive access, avoiding timeout when device is already in use
  * Large Artifact ID Fix: Support GitHub artifact IDs larger than 2^31 by
    using JavaScript's safe integer range (2^53)
  * Install Authorization Button: Added button to permission warning dialog
    for easier authorization flow
  * GitHub Artifact Handling: Improved artifact handling and branch filtering
