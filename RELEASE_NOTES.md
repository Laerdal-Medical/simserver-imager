# Release Notes

## What's New in {{VERSION}}

### Improvements

- **SPU Copy Speed Display**: The SPU copy step now shows transfer speed (MB/s), bytes transferred, and estimated time remaining during copy operations, matching the write step UI
- **SPU Copy Status Messages**: Show accurate "Flushing to USB drive..." status when data is being synced after copy completes, instead of showing the stale preparation message
